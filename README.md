# nightstalker
Clone of Nightstalker(tm) for the Intellivision in godot engine. 

Player character does not use node based movement, but probably should.

This is the first thing I have done in Godot Engine, so plenty could be improved. 

I left 2 cheats in place. F5 adds 5000 points.  F6 adds 100 bullets.  To remove them look at game/main.gd
