# nightstalker
Clone of Nightstalker(tm) for the Intellivision in godot engine. 
Now ported to 3.0, old version in branch godot2.

Player character does not use node based movement, but probably should.

This is the first thing I have done in Godot Engine, so plenty could be improved. 

I left 2 cheats in place. F5 adds 5000 points.  F6 adds 100 bullets.  To remove them look at game/main.gd
